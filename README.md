# Piscine – 42 Madrid

This repository contains the projects I completed during the 42 Piscine at 42 Madrid Fundación Telefónica.

The Piscine is an intensive four-week bootcamp designed to introduce students to programming in C and Unix environments. It focuses on problem-solving, memory management, algorithmic thinking, and peer-to-peer learning.

This repository includes:

- shell00
- shell01
- c00 → c07
- rush00

All projects were developed following the 42 Norm and compiled using:

cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror

## Shell Projects

### shell00

shell00 is an introduction to basic Unix commands and file system manipulation.

The exercises focus on:

- Navigating the file system
- Creating, deleting, and modifying files and directories
- Using basic commands such as ls, cat, echo, chmod
- Understanding permissions and file metadata

The goal of this project is to become comfortable using the terminal as a development environment.

---

### shell01

shell01 expands on shell00 with more advanced command usage.

The exercises include:

- File searching and filtering
- Redirections and pipes
- Text processing
- Combining commands efficiently

The objective is to improve productivity and fluency in a Unix environment.

---

## C Projects

The C modules progressively build a strong foundation in low-level programming.

---

### C00 – Introduction to C

- Writing simple functions
- Using the write function
- Understanding compilation
- Basic syntax

Goal: Understand how a C program is structured and executed.

---

### C01 – Pointers and Memory

- Declaring and using pointers
- Understanding memory addresses
- Working with arrays and references

Goal: Learn how memory works in C and how to manipulate data through pointers.

---

### C02 – Strings

- String manipulation
- Reimplementing common string-related functions
- Working with character arrays

Goal: Understand how strings are represented and handled in C.

---

### C03 – String Comparison and Search

- Comparing strings
- Searching inside strings
- Reproducing standard library behaviors

Goal: Strengthen algorithmic thinking through string operations.

---

### C04 – Integer Conversion and Output

- Converting strings to integers (atoi)
- Printing numbers
- Handling signs and edge cases

Goal: Implement parsing logic and handle numeric input safely.

---

### C05 – Recursion and Mathematics

- Recursive functions
- Factorial
- Fibonacci
- Power functions
- Prime number detection

Goal: Learn recursion and mathematical problem solving techniques.

---

### C06 – Program Arguments

- Using argc and argv
- Sorting arguments
- Displaying program parameters

Goal: Understand how programs receive and process command-line input.

---

### C07 – Dynamic Memory Allocation

- Using malloc
- Creating dynamic arrays
- Duplicating and manipulating strings
- Freeing allocated memory properly

Goal: Master dynamic memory management in C.

---

## Rush00

Rush00 is the first collaborative project of the Piscine.

It consists of:

- Working in a team under time constraints
- Applying previously learned C concepts
- Designing a small structured program

The goal of Rush00 is to simulate real teamwork, improve communication skills, and apply technical knowledge in a practical and intensive challenge.

---

## Compilation

All C projects were compiled using:

cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror

These flags enforce strict compilation rules and help prevent warnings from becoming runtime issues.

---

## Learning Experience

One of the most important aspects of the Piscine is peer-to-peer learning.

There are no traditional teachers. Progress depends on:

- Collaborating with other students
- Reviewing each other's code
- Explaining concepts to peers
- Learning through practice and evaluation

Teamwork, persistence, and mutual support were fundamental to successfully completing these projects.
