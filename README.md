# 42 Piscine C — November 2025

This repository contains all the projects I completed during the **42 Piscine at 42 Madrid**.  

The Piscine is an intensive 4-week program designed to introduce students to **C programming** and **UNIX systems**, emphasizing logic, autonomy, and collaboration. There are no teachers and no courses — you learn by doing, failing, and helping each other.

All projects were compiled using the 42 standard:

```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror

## What You Learn

Throughout the Piscine, you develop a variety of **technical and problem-solving skills** that form the foundation for future projects:

### Algorithmic Thinking
Learn to **break problems into small, logical steps** and approach challenges systematically.

### Core C Programming
Master **variables, loops, pointers, memory management, and structs**, ensuring a strong understanding of low-level programming concepts.

### UNIX Environment
Work confidently in the **UNIX terminal**, handling files, permissions, redirections, and shell scripting efficiently.

### Debugging and Edge Cases
Develop the ability to **identify and resolve errors quickly**, managing memory leaks and unexpected behaviors in your programs.

### Adherence to the 42 Norm
Write code that is **clean, readable, and maintainable**, following strict standards to reinforce good habits.

### Resource Management
Learn to **solve problems with limited tools**, as many projects restrict the use of standard library functions.

## Peer-to-Peer Learning

Collaboration is **at the core of the Piscine experience**. Students learn by working with and teaching each other.

- **Code Review:** Discuss and analyze classmates’ solutions to understand different approaches.  
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Explain your solutions and thought processes to peers, reinforcing your own understanding.  
- **Team Problem-Solving:** Collaborate to overcome difficult challenges and learn from mistakes.  
- **Communication Skills:** Practice presenting and defending technical ideas under pressure.  

This environment fosters **mutual support and growth**, and is essential to completing the projects successfully.

## Reflections

The Piscine is more than just programming — it is an **intense and immersive learning experience** that shapes your mindset.

- **Persistence:** Projects require repeated attempts, teaching patience and resilience.  
- **Independent Learning:** You learn how to learn, developing autonomy in problem-solving.  
- **Adaptability:** Each challenge pushes you to adapt quickly to new requirements and constraints.  
- **Confidence:** By the end of the program, you gain both **technical skills** and the ability to tackle complex problems in collaborative settings.  

Overall, the Piscine strengthens your **technical foundation, teamwork abilities, and problem-solving mindset**, providing a solid base for all future projects at 42.
